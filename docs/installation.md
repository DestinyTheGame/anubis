# Installation

So how do you install Anubis on your computer. First you need to download the
latest release from our release page:

https://github.com/DestinyTheGame/anubis/releases

The files are listed under the *downloads* section in that page.

## Windows

The Windows files are prefixed with `win32-<arch>`. Make sure you download the
correct arch. If you are using a 64bit windows installation make sure you
download the file that is suffixed with `x64`. For all other Windows versions
use the `ia32` file.

Now that the file is downloaded you need to unzip it. If you do not have an
application that can unzip the `.zip` extension you can download a free
application from http://www.7-zip.org/ and unzip the application. Once you've
unzipped the file there's a small `anubis.exe` in the resulting folder. Just
double click it and it will pop-up with a warming telling that it's not signed
code and made by "untrusted developer" (they charge you 300 euro to sign it).
Accept it and you're able to launch the application.

## Mac OSX

The file that you need to download is suffixed with `darwin`. The file you
downloaded is `zip`. Double click to unzip the file and it should result in
a folder. Just move the `Anubis.app` to your `Applications` folder.
